Doo doo doo do, do do, do do
Doo doo doo do

Doo doo doo do, do do, do do

In the sweet old country where I come from
Nobody ever works
Nothing ever gets done
We hang fire, we hang fire

You know marrying money is a full time job
I don't need the aggravation
I'm a lazy slob
I hang fire, I hang fire
Hang fire, put it on the wire, baby, yeah
I hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby

Yeah
I hang fire

We've got nothing to eat
We got nowhere to work
Nothing to drink
We just lost our shirts
I'm on the dole
We ain't for hire
Say what the Hell
Say what the Hell, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby

Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do, do do, do do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do, do do, do do

Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire

Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do, do do, do do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo do, do do, do do

Ya have ten thousand dollars, gonna have some fun
Put it all on at a hundred to one
Hang fire, ah, hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire, put it on the wire
