Our own correspondent
Is sorry to tell
Of an uneasy time
That all is not well

On the borders there's movement
In the hills there is trouble
Food is short
Crime is double

Prices have risen
Snce the government fell
Casualties increase
As the enemy shell

The climate's unhealthy
Flies and rats thrive
And sooner or later
The end will arrive

This is your correspondent 
Running out of tape
Gunfire's increasing
Looting, burning, rape...
