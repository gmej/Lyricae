You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak
Lies and misery

I know it's wrong
But I can't turn away
The flames draw near
They're telling me to stay

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm falling into the fire

Your love burns bright
And yet the flames are cold
This time I fear
You won't be back no more

When will it end
Your love consumes my soul
Into the fire
I'm being tempted once more

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm falling

Take me back where I came from
Don't want to see your face no more
You broke my heart
Now it's not the same
I'm falling again
I'm falling again

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm falling again
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm falling again
Into the fire
I'm falling
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm falling
Into the fire
