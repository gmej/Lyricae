# Lyricae

Lyricae is an assistant tool for composing lyrics by making recommendations based on sentiment selected and the verses written by the user. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project consists in two fundamental parts: first lyrics scraping and processing to create the dataframes for the recommendation system, and the application itself.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For the live application it is required Python 3.7 or higher, and nodeJS v12.18.0

In order to create the database, you will only need Python 3.7.

#### Linux prerequisites

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```

The project was developed in the specified versions , and it has not been tested with previous versions in which it might work as well.

<!-- 
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
